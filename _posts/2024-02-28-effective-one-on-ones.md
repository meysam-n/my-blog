One-on-one meetings are your most powerful tool as a leader. Done well, they build trust, surface problems early, and accelerate growth.

## Why 1:1s Matter

Regular 1:1s help you:
- Build trust and rapport
- Understand individual motivations
- Provide timely feedback
- Catch issues before they escalate
- Support career development

## Structure That Works

### The 30-Minute Framework

- **First 10 min**: Their agenda - What's on your mind?
- **Middle 10 min**: Discussion - Dig deeper into raised topics
- **Last 10 min**: Growth & action items

## Questions to Ask

### Opening Questions
- "What's top of mind for you?"
- "How's the week going so far?"
- "Anything I can help unblock?"

### Growth-Focused Questions
- "What skills do you want to develop?"
- "What kind of work energizes you?"
- "Where do you see yourself in a year?"

### Feedback Questions
- "What could I do differently to support you better?"
- "Is there anything about the team that concerns you?"

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

### Making It a Status Update
The 1:1 is their time. Aim for a 70/30 split in their favor.

### Canceling or Rescheduling
Consistency builds trust. Treat 1:1s as sacred time.

### Not Taking Notes
Document key points and follow up on action items.

## Conclusion

Great 1:1s require preparation and presence. Invest in them, and you'll see the return in team trust, performance, and retention.
