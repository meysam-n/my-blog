Culture isn't what you say—it's what you do. Building a strong engineering culture requires intentional effort and consistent reinforcement.

## Pillars of Engineering Culture

1. **Psychological Safety**
2. **Technical Excellence**
3. **Continuous Learning**
4. **Autonomy & Ownership**

## Psychological Safety

People must feel safe to:
- Ask questions
- Admit mistakes
- Challenge ideas
- Take risks

### How to Build It
- Respond positively to questions
- Share your own mistakes openly
- Thank people for raising concerns
- Never punish honest failures

## Technical Excellence

High standards attract and retain great engineers.

### Code Reviews
- Focus on learning, not gatekeeping
- Praise good patterns, not just problems
- Review promptly (within 24 hours)

### Quality Ownership
"You build it, you run it" creates accountability.

## Continuous Learning

### Knowledge Sharing
- Tech talks and brown bags
- Internal blog or wiki
- Pair programming rotations
- Architecture review sessions

### Experimentation
- Hackathons
- Innovation sprints
- 20% time projects

## Autonomy and Ownership

### Give Context, Not Control
Instead of: "Build feature X this way"
Try: "Users need to solve problem Y. How might we address this?"

## Conclusion

Culture is built daily through small actions. Lead by example, be intentional about what you reward, and remember: the culture you have is the one you've built.
